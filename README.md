AKQA Developer Test
===================

Thanks for taking part in the AKQA Developer Test!

**The Basics:**

The test will allow you to demonstrate your skills using HTML5, CSS3 (SASS), and JavaScript.

The repo includes PSD's and supporting assets. You will be expected to build the page according to the PSD; accounting for desktop, as well as mobile and tablet devices.

You may be required to write JavaScript to allow for functionality changes between viewports (showing/hiding of content and/or navigation elements).

Rename the directory "your-name" to your own name - your completed code should live inside this directory.

**General Notes:**

Do not use HTML libraries/frameworks (such as HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap, Foundation or any prebuilt grid systems).

You can use Modernizr and/or Selectivizr, along with a single JavaScript library such as jQuery if you wish, but you may not use any other plugins, libraries or frameworks (such as AngularJS).

Requirements and considerations
-------

You should build the page as you feel necessary, however the following should be taken into consideration:

#### Accessibility

Ensure that your markup takes into account basic accessibility standards. For example, the page can be viewed and used without the need for JavaScript to be enabled and any alt attributes and similar are set.

####	Standards Compliance

Ensure that your markup is W3C compliant. For example, all tags are correctly closed, tags are nested correctly and that all necessary attributes for a tag are set. Your page should validate against the online W3C checker.

####	HTML Semantics

Ensure that your markup is semantic. For example, information follows a logical flow throughout the document and is marked up using the most appropriate tag where necessary.

####	CSS (SASS)

Ideally SASS should be used when writing your CSS. Try to demonstrate how preprocessors can be used in your development workflow to enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

####	JavaScript

Ensure you write neat, tidy JavaScript that you would consider suitable for a live web site.

####	Build Tools

You may use build tools such as Grunt/Gulp to compile and/or minify your CSS/JS, or a GUI if you'd prefer.
Bonus points will be awarded for showing knowledge of build tools, if time permits.

Note: If minifying your code, please ensure to also include the source files for inspection.

####	Browsers

The page should function and resemble the creative in the following web browsers:

*	Google Chrome (latest)
*	Firefox (latest)
*	Safari (latest)
*	IE9 +

----------

Take as much time as you feel necessary to complete the test. When submitting your test, include information about any tools you used, including the editor used to write your code and time taken to complete the test.

Good luck!
