Music Browser
=============

The Brief
-------

Music Browser is a fictional music discovery and news platform aimed at music enthusiasts. The 'website' is intended to allow users to view articles on new music, discover emerging artists and view trending songs curated by users.


Instructions
-------

This repo is intended as a training tool and skills assessment that mimics a typical workflow. Provided are PSDs for mobile and desktop. You will be expected to use these to build a responsive page, utilizing HTML5, CSS3 (SASS) and JavaScript.

To begin, please fork this repository.  Rename the directory **your-name** to your GitHub username.  Complete the exercise in this directory and commit changes to your local fork. Once complete, fill out the README.md that exists in the same directory.

To submit your work, please reach out to the person who gave you access to this repository - this will likely be the recruiter you are working with.

Requirements
-------

1. You may use [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) and/or [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com), but other libraries (jQuery), frameworks (Backbone.js/AngularJS), or plugins are **not permitted**.

2. You are encouraged to use CSS Preprocessors like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), but it is **not permitted** to use any prebuilt grid systems or frameworks (Bootstrap/Foundation).

3. You will be required to write JavaScript to allow for functionality changes between viewports (showing/hiding of content and/or navigation elements). Refer to the PSD's to determine where JS functionality is necessary and implement where necessary.

4. Please comment your HTML, CSS and JavaScript where necessary.

5. Write useful commit messages.

Considerations
-------

#### Design

Your completed page should match the design as closely as possible. The page should be completely fluid, i.e. the page does not break when moving between mobile and desktop breakpoints.

Take into consideration that the PSDs have been designed for retina displays.

#### Standards Compliance

Ensure that your markup is W3C compliant.

#### HTML Semantics

Ensure that your markup is semantic.

#### Accessibility

Ensure that your markup takes into account basic accessibility (WCAG 2.0) standards.

#### CSS (SASS)

SASS is encouraged when writing your CSS. Try to demonstrate how preprocessors can be used in your development workflow to enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

#### JavaScript

Ensure to write clean, structured JavaScript that you feel would be suitable for a live website.

#### Build Tools

You may use build tools such as [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to compile, minify, or other common tasks.  If minifying your code, please ensure to also include the source files for inspection.

#### Browser Support

The page should function and resemble the creative in all **latest** desktop/mobile browsers.
