Music Browser
=============

**Summary:**

Music Browser is a fictional music discovery and news platform aimed at music enthusiasts. The 'website' is intended to allow users to view articles on new music, discover emerging artists and view trending songs curated by users.

**The Basics:**

This repository is intended to be used as both a skills assessment and a training tool. To begin, please fork this repository and complete the work detailed below in your local fork.

In the repository you will find PSD's and supporting assets. You are expected to build the PSD using HTML5, CSS3 (SASS), and JavaScript; accounting for desktop, as well as mobile and tablet devices.

**General Notes:**

Do not use HTML libraries/frameworks (such as HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap, Foundation or any prebuilt grid systems).

You can use Modernizr and/or Selectivizr, but you **may not** use any other plugins, libraries or frameworks (such as jQuery or AngularJS).

Preprocessors (LESS/SASS) and build tools (Grunt/Gulp) are permitted - see requirements below for more information.

You will be required to write JavaScript to allow for functionality changes between viewports (showing/hiding of content and/or navigation elements). Refer to the PSD's to determine where JS functionality is necessary.

Please comment your HTML, CSS and JavaScript extensively. You are writing code to be consumed by human beings who care about how you write code and how you think about solving engineering problems. Ensure to also write useful commit messages.

Requirements
-------

You should build the page as you feel necessary, however the following should be taken into consideration:

####	Design

Your completed page should match the design as closely as possible. You should ensure your page is completely fluid, i.e. the page does not break when moving between mobile and desktop breakpoints.

Note: The PSD's have been designed for Retina. Take that into consideration when building out your page.

####	Standards Compliance

Ensure that your markup is W3C compliant. For example, all tags are correctly closed, tags are nested correctly and that all necessary attributes for a tag are set. Your page should validate against the online W3C checker.

####	HTML Semantics

Ensure that your markup is semantic. For example, information follows a logical flow throughout the document and is marked up using the most appropriate tag where necessary.

#### Accessibility

Ensure that your markup takes into account basic accessibility (WCAG 2.0) standards.

####	CSS (SASS)

SASS is preferred when writing your CSS. Try to demonstrate how preprocessors can be used in your development workflow to enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

####	JavaScript

Ensure to write clean, structured JavaScript that you feel would be suitable for a live website.

####	Build Tools

You may use build tools such as Grunt/Gulp to compile and/or minify your CSS/JS, or a GUI if you'd prefer.
Bonus points will be awarded for showing knowledge of build tools, if time permits.

Note: If minifying your code, please ensure to also include the source files for inspection.

####	Browser Support

The page should function and resemble the creative in all **latest** desktop/mobile browsers.
