Music Browser
=============

**The Basics:**

This repository is intended to be used as both a skills assessment and a training tool.  To begin, please fork this repository and complete the work detailed below in your local fork.

All you will find in this repository are PSD's and supporting assets.   You are expected to build the PSD in HTML, CSS3 (SASS), and JavaScript; accounting for desktop, as well as mobile and tablet devices.

**General Notes:**

Do not use HTML libraries/frameworks (such as HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap, Foundation or any prebuilt grid systems).

You can use Modernizr and/or Selectivizr, along with a single JavaScript library such as jQuery if you wish, but you may not use any other plugins, libraries or frameworks (such as AngularJS).

You may be required to write JavaScript to allow for functionality changes between viewports (showing/hiding of content and/or navigation elements).

Preprocessors (LESS/SASS) and build tools (Grunt/Gulp) are permitted - see below for more information.

Please comment extensively.  You are writing code to be consumed by human beings who care about how you write code and how you think about solving engineering problems.  Comment your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Write useful commit messages.

Requirements and considerations
-------

You should build the page as you feel necessary, however the following should be taken into consideration:

####	Standards Compliance

Ensure that your markup is W3C compliant. For example, all tags are correctly closed, tags are nested correctly and that all necessary attributes for a tag are set. Your page should validate against the online W3C checker.

####	HTML Semantics

Ensure that your markup is semantic. For example, information follows a logical flow throughout the document and is marked up using the most appropriate tag where necessary.

####	CSS (SASS)

SASS is preferred when writing your CSS. Try to demonstrate how preprocessors can be used in your development workflow to enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

####	JavaScript

Ensure you write neat, tidy JavaScript that you would consider suitable for a live web site.

####	Build Tools

You may use build tools such as Grunt/Gulp to compile and/or minify your CSS/JS, or a GUI if you'd prefer.
Bonus points will be awarded for showing knowledge of build tools, if time permits.

Note: If minifying your code, please ensure to also include the source files for inspection.

####	Browsers

The page should function and resemble the creative in the following web browsers:

*	Google Chrome (latest)
*	Firefox (latest)
*	Safari (latest)
*	IE9+

#### Operating Systems

The page should function and resemble the creative on the following operating systems:

* Mac OS (latest)
* Windows (latest)
* iOS (latest)
* Android (latest)

#### Accessibility

Ensure that your markup takes into account basic accessibility standards. For example, the page can be viewed and used without the need for JavaScript to be enabled and any alt attributes and similar are set.
