Music Browser
=============

The Brief
-------

Music Browser is a fictional music discovery and news platform aimed at music enthusiasts. The 'website' is intended to allow users to view articles on new music, discover emerging artists and view trending songs curated by users.


Instructions
-------

Music Browser has been designed as a training tool and a skills assessment that mimics a typical workflow.  The creative team has given us PSDs that they'd like to see implemented across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.  The assets you need have already been sliced.  All that you need to do is create the HTML5, CSS3 (SASS), and JavaScript to make the designs a reality.

To begin, please fork this repository.  Rename the "your-name" directory to your GitHub username.  Complete the exercise in this directory and commit your changes to your local fork.  When you are done, add a README.md that includes instructions on how to use your submission and what tools you chose to use.

To submit your work, please reach out to the person who gave you access to this repository.  Candidates, this will be the recruiter you are working with.

Requirements
-------

1. You may use [https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr](Modernizr) or [https://github.com/keithclark/selectivizr](Selectivizr), but other libraries, frameworks, or plugins are strongly discouraged.

2. You are encouraged to use CSS Preprocessors like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) or [less](http://lesscss.org/), but discouraged from using prebuilt grid systems.

3.  You will be required to write JavaScript to allow for functionality changes between viewports (showing/hiding of content and/or navigation elements). Refer to the PSD's to determine where JS functionality is necessary.

4. Please comment your HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You are writing code to be consumed by human beings who care about how you write code and how you think about solving engineering problems.

5. Write useful commit messages.

Style Guide
-------

#### Design

Your completed page should match the design as closely as possible. When complete, the page should be completely fluid, i.e. the page does not break when moving between mobile and desktop breakpoints.

Take into consideration that the PSDs have been designed for retina displays.

#### Standards Compliance

Ensure that your markup is W3C compliant.

#### HTML Semantics

Ensure that your markup is semantic.

#### Accessibility

Ensure that your markup takes into account basic accessibility (WCAG 2.0) standards.

#### CSS (SASS)

SASS is preferred when writing your CSS, but if you feel more confident with less, please use it. Try to demonstrate how preprocessors can be used in your development workflow to enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

#### JavaScript

Ensure to write clean, structured JavaScript that you feel would be suitable for a live website.

#### Build Tools

You may use build tools such as [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to compile, minify, or other common tasks.  If minifying your code, please ensure to also include the source files for inspection.

#### Browser Support

The page should function and resemble the creative in all **latest** desktop/mobile browsers.
